## **Myth :no_good:**

## “I’d be a terrible speaker”

## **Debunk :ok_woman:**

## 	You don’t need to<br>be perfect

^ You just need to be good enough to make a start
Start small, practice a lot
Making mistakes is part of learning and being a dev
You will learn and grow
Everyone gets nervous!

---

## **Myth :no_good:**

## “I’m not an expert”

---

## **Debunk :ok_woman:**

## You don’t need to be<br>to succeed

^ You don't need to be a super duper coding expert in order to qualify to talk

Your point of view, your way of seeing things is unique. We need diverse viewpoints

Your background, education, experiences are valuable

Experts and long standing members in the field often lose touch with the basics, getting started, learning something for the first time...

## **Myth :no_good:**

## “But I’m not ready yet!”

^ You'll never be 100% ready...

### **Getting Started**

## Talk Types

^ To the wall!
So hopefully you've come somewhat prepared to this workshop with a topic in mind. 
Even with a topic though, it's useful to figure out what type of talk best fits your topic.

Refer to examples:
Overview - Code, tools, process, workflow
Case Study - how using xyz improved user engagement
Deep Dive - getting in to the nitty gritty
Let me show you - how to...
What we learned - mistakes we made, lessons learned

Specify the audience.

---

### **Submitting a talk**

## The abstract

^ The abstract is a fancy way of saying the blurb
There is a particular style and structure to follow
(refer to abstract handout)

---

### **Activity** :sparkles:

## Write an abstract for your (5m) lightning talk :pencil:

## **Audience, Talk Type,<br>Title, Description**

^ Refer to abstract handout notes
Need examples of audience? DevConf has a wide range of attendees, from folks just starting in the industry to tech veterans. There will be a wide range of skill sets and roles among those attending.

Need examples of talk types, check out the posters
Remember this is a quick first draft, it doesn't need to be perfect

# Preparing<br>a talk

---

## **Preparing a talk**

## Practice

^ The best and most important bit of advice
Start by reading out loud to yourself in a mirror
Practice reading to a pet or close friend
Do a demo / practice run for co-workers

3 big things

---

## **Practice**

## Your words 💬

^ Knowing your talk gives you confidence and a sense of security
This will in turn make you comfortable with improvising

---

## **Practice**

## Your timing ⏱

^ We either tend to run really short or really long
Getting a better sense of our timing also helps with pace. You don't want to be racing along, or umming and ahing with looong pauses
Practicing a few times while timing yourself is super valuable

---

## **Practice**

## Again and again 🔁

^ A few times is probably enough

---

### **Activity** :sparkles:

## Write a<br>:zap: lightning talk

## On an index card<br>to keep it short

^ About 5 minutes.
A little short is fine.
You already have your audience, talk type, title, abstract
If you do slides, 1 or 2 plain ones is probably okay: not enough time for design today

Each person takes a turn to give their talk to the others
One person should keep time

It's only a first draft
Not gonna be perfect
But will give you some useful feedback, some new ideas
Stand up. Yes, it’s silly. Yes, it helps.
