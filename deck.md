So hopefully you've come somewhat prepared to this workshop with a topic in mind. 
Even with a topic though, it's useful to figure out what type of talk best fits your topic.

^ Refer to examples:
Overview - Code, tools, process, workflow
Case Study - how using xyz improved user engagement
Deep Dive - getting in to the nitty gritty
Let me show you - how to...
What we learned - mistakes we made, lessons learned

---

### **Submitting to DevConf**

## Tip#1Ô∏è‚É£
## Answer the WHY

Why are you the best person to deliver this content

---

### **Submitting to DevConf**

## Tip#1Ô∏è‚É£ Advice: 
## Who would be a typical DevConf attendee? 

^ To help you answer this question, think about the typical DevConf attendee...
Who is paying for their ticket?
Would they believe you're offering real value?

---

### **Submitting to DevConf**

## Tip#2Ô∏è‚É£
## Describe the talk clearly

^ Talks that do well have a clear descrition
The reviewer should know what they'll get from attending your talk
i.e. an answer to a question, a usefull new skill etc

---

### **Submitting to DevConf**

## Tip#2Ô∏è‚É£ Advice:
## Ask a friend to<br>read your submission

^ Ask a friend to read your submission and tell you what they think your talk is about
Don't pre-empt them with an explanation or try explain if they start looking confused
Let them read it through and tell you what they think

---

### **Submitting to DevConf**

## Tip#3Ô∏è‚É£
## Be the change<br>you want to see

^ Talks that describe problems aren't useful
DevConf's slogan is "Solving today and tomorrow's software development challenges"

---

### **Submitting to DevConf**

## Tip#3Ô∏è‚É£ Advice:
## Explain the impact<br>you've made

^ If talking about topics such as diversity or inclusion challenges, be able to articulate what impact you've made
If you want to talk about women in tech, be a woman in tech
Focus on solutions and positive impact, while trying to avoid victimhood


---

### **Submitting to DevConf**

## Tip#4
## Do something different

^ If you're simply submitting a talk you've already done for a different conference, it doesn't earn you any street cred 

---

### **Submitting to DevConf**

## Tip#4 Advice:
## Show how you've<br>reworked and<br>improved things!

^ If you‚Äôre repeating a talk, clearly articulate how you‚Äôve
collected feedback and improved the talk since.

### **Activity** :sparkles:

## **Preparing a talk**

## Practice

^ The best and most important bit of advice
Start by reading out loud to yourself in a mirror
Practice reading to a pet or close friend
Do a demo / practice run for co-workers

^ 3 big things

---

## **Practice**

## Your words üí¨

^ Knowing your talk gives you confidence and a sense of security
This will in turn make you comfortable with improvising

---

## **Practice**

## Your timing ‚è±

^ We either tend to run really short or really long
Getting a better sense of our timing also helps with pace. You don't want to be racing along, or umming and ahing with looong pauses
Practicing a few times while timing yourself is super valuable

---

## **Practice**

## Again and again üîÅ

^ A few times is probably enough

---

### **Activity** :sparkles:

## Write a<br>:zap: lightning version of your DevConf talk

## On an index card<br>to keep it short

^ Audience input: Can anyone explain what a lightning talk is?
About 5 minutes.
A little short is fine.
You already have your audience, talk type, title, abstract
If you do slides, 1 or 2 plain ones is probably okay: not enough time for design today

^ Groups of 4
Each person takes a turn to give their talk to the others
One person should keep time 
stop at 5mins, whatever happens!
It's only a first draft
Not gonna be perfect
But will give you some useful feedback, some new ideas
Stand up. Yes, it‚Äôs silly. Yes, it helps.

---
